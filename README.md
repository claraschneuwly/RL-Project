Final Project for course 6.8200 - Computational Sensorimotor Learning at MIT

The objective of this project is to model the dynamics of the ocean environment, factoring in swell motions and wind velocities, and the interaction of various agents with these forces as it navigates through it. This simulates the conditions of an agent picking up plastics in a fluid-mechanics informed environment.
